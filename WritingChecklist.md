# A checklist for not annoying the reviewer

1. Check for LaTeX errors. In the pdf document, you can:
  - Ctrl+f for question marks (?)
  - Ctrl+f for slashes (forward and backward)

2. Check capital letters (and full stops).
  - In sentences (do any sentences finish half way through?).
  - In titles (are all sub-titles consistently capitalised).
  - Brand or algorithm names (like YouTube, youtube, you tube - pick one and use it throughout!).

3. Check white space.
  - Is there a space after every full stop, comma, punctuation mark?
  - Are there any spaces BEFORE punctuation marks (remove them)?
  - Have any words run together? A spell checker might find this.
  - Is the document layout appropriate?

3. Check grammar and spelling.
  - Consider Grammarly.
  - Do use a spell checker.
  - Tenses (be consistent, existing work consistently in the past tense).
  - At final drafts, consider a proof reader.

4. Check figures.
  - Are they complete (or do some of them get chopped up)?
  - Is all the text in the figures legible?
  - Would they print ok in black and white?
  - Do you actually USE every figure (i.e. refer to it from within the text)?
  - Are they consistently captioned?
  - Figure captions at the bottom.
  - Cite the source (if relevant).
  - Are they conveniently positioned close to where they're used?
  - Check the image quality in the final document.

5. Check tables.
  - Do you use all the tables within the body of text?
  - Are tables legible?
  - Table titles at the top.
